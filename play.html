        <h6> ACT II</h6>
        <h6>SCENE II
            Dorine, Orgon, Mariane</h6>
            <p>
            
                  <h6 class="orgon name">orgon</h6>. 
                  <p class="speech"> What do you stare at?
                    You must be eaten up with curiosity
                    To eavesdrop on my daughter and me.</p>



                   <h6 class="dorine name">dorine</h6>
                   <p class="speech">I don't know whether the rumor I hear
                    Is sly conjecture or a wicked smear;
                    But I've just heard word of this marriage,
                    And I trust it is only verbiage.</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name"> Orgon.</h6>
                    <p class="speech">  Why?  Is the idea itself so very absurd?</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine.</h6>  
                    <p class="stagedirection"> I wouldn't believe it</p> 
                    <p class="speech"> if you gave your word!</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">I will make you believe it by-and-by.</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine.
                    <p class="speech">Yes.  You're going to tell us a bald-faced lie.</p>
           
                  
                    <h6 class="orgon name"> Orgon.</h6>
                    <p class="speech">Hear me!
                    I have given you too much liberty,
                    And it no longer gives me any pleasure.</p>


                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine.</h6>
                    <p class="speech">Monsieur, please.  Keep your anger within measure.
                    Are you mocking us with your silly plot?
                    Your daughter is no match for a bigot;
                    He has other schemes to worry about.
                    And what would you gain if she wed this lout?
                    With your wealth, what benefit would it bring
                    To pick a bum . . .</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6> 
                    <p class="stagedirection">Ssh!  Say he has nothing;</p>
                    <p class="speech">For that reason, you should revere him the more.
                    He is a holy man and nobly poor.
                    It raises him up to greater grandeur
                    That he has renounced all wealth by his pure
                    Detachment from the merely temporal
                    And his powerful love for the Eternal.
                    But my assistance may give him the means
                    To restore his lands and remove his liens.
                    He is a man of repute in the land of his birth,
                    And, even as he is, he's a man of worth.</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"> Dorine.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech">Yes, so he tells us, but his vanity
                    Does not sit so well with true piety.
                    A man pleased with a simple sanctity
                    Needn't vaunt his and his dignity,
                    And the humility born of devotion
                    Suffers beneath such blatant ambition.
                    What good is his pride? . . . But perhaps I digress:
                    Let's speak of the man--not his nobleness.
                    Can you bestow, without feeling like a rat,
                    A girl like this on a man like that?
                    And shouldn't you think of propriety
                    And foresee the end with anxiety?
                    We know that some girls cannot remain chaste
                    If their husband's tush is not to their taste,
                    And that the best-laid plans for an honest life
                    Are somewhat easier for the best-laid wife,
                    And that many a man with a horned head
                    Has driven his wife to another man's bed.
                    It is entirely too much to ask
                    That a wife be faithful to a flabby ass.
                    And one who gives a girl to a man she hates
                    Is guilty before God for all her mistakes.
                    Consider the perils you expose yourself to.</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>
                    <p class="speech">So you think I should learn how to live from you!</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">You could do worse than follow my lead.</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name"> Orgon.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech">Dear daughter, do drop this maid's daffy creed;
                    I know what's best for you in this affair.
                    It's true I betrothed you to young Valere,
                    But I hear he likes his dicing and drinking
                    And even worse is inclined to free-thinking.
                    I note with regret we don't see him at mass.</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"> Dorine.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">Must he be there the same moment you pass
                    Like those who attend only to be seen?</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech">Your advice isn't wanted.  Don't intervene.
                    Tartuffe is on the path to salvation,
                    And that is a treasure past calculation.
                    This wedding will bring blessings beyond measure,
                    And be crowned with great sweetness and pleasure.
                    Together you will live, thriving on love
                    Like new-born babes, or a pair of turtledoves.
                    You will never be found in angry debate
                    For you will find all that you wish in this mate.</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech">She'll only make him a cuckold, I'm sure.</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">What?</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"> Dorine.</h6>         
                    <p class="speech"> He looks just like a caricature,
                    And his fate, monsieur, will make him an ass
                    No matter how much virtue your daughter has.</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">Don't interrupt me and remember your place
                    And quit sticking your nose up in my face!</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"></h6> Dorine.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">I'm only trying, sir, to protect you.</p>
            
                    
            
                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">You're too kind, but do shut up--please do!</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"> Dorine.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">If I didn't like you . . .</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name"> Orgon.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech">                            I don't need liking.</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"> Dorine.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech"> But I will like you, sir, despite your griping.</p>


                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech"> Oh?</p>


                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine.</h6>   
                    <p class="speech">    Your honor is dear and I'd be provoked
                    To find you the butt of some smutty joke.</p>


                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">Can't you keep quiet?</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"> Dorine.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">                              In all good conscience,
                    It's a shame to foster such an alliance.</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>  
                        <p class="speech">Shut up, you viper, with your brazen traits . . .</p>


                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">What?  You've been reborn, yet you give way to hate?</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech"> Yes, your twaddle has made me quite high-strung,
                    And I now insist that you hold your tongue.</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name"> Dorine.</h6> 
                    <p class="speech"> All right.  But I'll think in silence nonetheless.</p>

                    <h6 class="orgon name">Orgon.</h6>  
                    <p class="speech">Think if you wish to, but strive for success
                    At shutting your mouth . . . or beware.  [Turning to his daughter]  Let's see,
                    I have weighed everything quite maturely.</p>

                    <h6 class="dorine name">Dorine [aside].</h6> 
                    <p class="speech">I hate this silence.  [She falls quiet every time Orgon turns toward her.]</p>
